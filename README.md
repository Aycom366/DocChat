## Vector Database

A vector database is a collection of data stored as mathematical representations. Vector databases make it easier for machine learning models to remember previous inputs, allowing machine learning to be used to power search, recommendations, and text generation use-cases

### Vector Database Setup

#### Configuration

1536 as the dimensions because OpenAi (used for the semantics) always return back an array that consists of 1536 array of number
